  Snaplet gives developers production-accurate PostgreSQL data and preview databases that they can code against.
  It does this by capturing a 'snapshot' of a database, copying the schema, and providing a JavaScript runtime for
  transforming, reducing (subsetting) and generating synthetic data.
  Developers can then share these snapshots with their team for collaborative development.
